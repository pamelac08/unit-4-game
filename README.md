### Project Description:

This is an application for playing a Crystal Collector game

* As an introduction to jQuery, this application features dynamically updated HTML and CSS using jQuery
* To begin, the computer randomly picks a number for the player to match
* Use of click event on four crystal buttons to capture user input
* At the beginning of the game, the computer randomly assigns a value to each of the four crystals which are hidden from the player
* As the player clicks/selects a crystal, the players total score is updated
* The game automatically resets when the player wins or loses
* The player wins if their total score matches the computer's selection exactly 
* The player loses if their total score goes above the target number
* The application will also keep track of the number of games the player has won or lost in a single browser session


Primarily used click event listeners, random number generation (using a for loop), and conditional statements to run this application.
